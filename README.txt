These are the files that contributed to the development of my thesis: "AI working for you to purchase your dream car":
-The selenium script 'car_script.py' was built to gather the characteristics of 33,000+ cars on the internet.
-The dataset 'Scraped carsW.csv' was the final, fully-processed dataset of car models that was applied to each machine learning algorithm.
-The Python Notebook file 'ML_Implementation.ipynb' contains the implementation for methods: Gradient Boosting Machine, Logistic Regression
Convolution Neural networks 
with an evalutation of each method's competency through metrics: RMSE, MAE, R^2 analysis. And performance graphs.
